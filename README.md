GAMEPLAY:
Select one of the four bunnies to play as. Then, choose one of the remaining bunnies to battle against.

Press the "attack" button to attack the current enemy.  Your attack power will increase after each successful attack. If the enemy survives the attack, it will counter attack, causing you damage.

If you succesfully kill the current enemy, you must then fight the remaining enemies.  Your health does not regenerate.  If at any point, the enemies counter attack causes you to lose all your health, you lose the game.  The game will then restart.

HOW TO WIN:

Succesfully defeat all of the enemies without losing all of your health.
